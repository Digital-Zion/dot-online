## Visions of a New Internet

Platforms like YouTube, Patreon, Spotify, Instagram (Meta), TikTok, and more are only becoming more centralized, more intrusive, more greedy, and more exploitative.

They don’t respect our privacy, they’re treated like competitive marketplaces instead of tools for human connection and communication, and the people who make them run are largely inaccessible.

To top it all off, we don’t control them _at all,_ despite being the reason they exist...

That's why [**400,000,000**](https://400000000.co) and their collective of artists are partnering with a design and development agency called [**Sanctuary Computer**](https://www.sanctuary.computer) to build [cooperative,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_cooperative) [decentralized,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization#Technological_decentralization) and [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) alternatives that synthesize the best features of all these platforms, and that we can [(democratically)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy) control together too _(with no crypto schemes or gimmicks either)._

It's time for us humans to have an exodus to a _**Digital Zion**_ that we’ve built ourselves – somewhere where _**all**_ of us can actually have a say over the technology that we’re using to communicate with each other.

Imagine a new social media ecosystem designed around cooperation. Controlled and maintained by all willing to get invested, and in a radically democratic way. Not just one platform controlled by the people for the commons (like [Resonate](https://resonate.is/), for example), but many, all reinforcing each other.

_We are beginning with a video-streaming platform called [Spex](https://opencollective.com/digitalzion/projects/spex) that has **1)** Patreon features baked into it, and **2)** a more decentralized architecture, and **3)** a more modular system for connection and curation._
