## Visions of a New Internet

Platforms like YouTube, Patreon, Spotify, Instagram (Meta), TikTok, and more are only becoming more centralized, more intrusive, more greedy, and more exploitative. They don’t respect our privacy, they’re viewed as marketplaces instead of tools for healthy connection and communication, and the people who make them run are largely inaccessible.

To top all of these things off, we don’t control them at all despite being the reason they exist...

That's why [400000000](https://400000000.co) and their collective of artists are partnering with a design and development agency called [**Sanctuary Computer**](https://www.sanctuary.computer) to build [cooperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_cooperative), [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization#Technological_decentralization), and [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) alternatives that synthesize the best features of all those platforms, and that we can ([democratically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy)) control together too.

_With no crypto schemes or gimmicks either..._

It's time for us humans to have an exodus to a Digital Zion that we’ve built ourselves. 

Somewhere where all of us can actually have a say over the technology that we’re using to communicate with each other.

_We are beginning with a video-streaming platform that has 1) Patreon features baked into it, and 2) a more decentralized architecture._
